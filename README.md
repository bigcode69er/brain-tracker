# Mental Health Tracker

A full-stack web application that allows users to track their mood and sleep, as well as keep track of resources to help on their journies to better health and wellness.

## Technology Stack

Front-End: ReactJS  
Back-End: Node, Express, Postgres

## Proposed Development Tools

Enzyme for React front-end snapshot testing while following the Airbnb style guides (ESLint)  
Jest for the front and back-end

## Testing

REST Testing with POSTMAN

## Problems in Development

Sequelize Hooks and Seeding, and Passport JS implementation  
When snapshot testing the front-end, there was an issue with dependencies. For example, the CSS and component library for Bulma, as well as React Router were installed in the root of the project with the back-end but were used in the front-end (view directory).
